# coverage

Exploring some ideas for instrumenting Clojure code and reporting on test coverage.

## Usage

This project is not yet in a usable state.  I hope to eventually expose the following things:

+ A core library that you can use to instrument your Clojure code, for the purposes of test coverage reporting, profiling, or whatever.  Maybe this part would be a useful addition to clojure-contrib.

+ A command-line tool that takes a list of namespaces, instruments them, runs tests, and produces text or HTML reports.  Also optionally fire up a Compojure server.

+ Leiningen plugin.

+ Maven plugin.

+ Ant tasks.
